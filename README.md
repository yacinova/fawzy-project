# 🚀 TCS — Technical Capability System

A premium, data-driven **Engineer Performance and Ranking Platform** built with **Next.js 16** and **Firebase**. This system gamifies the technical excellence of field service engineers by dynamically measuring their monthly and quarterly KPIs, translating them into a unified **Technical Capability Score (TCS)**, and assigning them prestigious **Tiers**.

 *"Precision Defines Rank. Earn Your Tier • Own Your Title."*

## 🌟 What is this project?
<<<<<<< HEAD
The **TCS Ecosystem** replaces subjective engineer evaluations with a transparent, visually stunning, and competitive performance hub. By tracking core metrics—operational KPIs, Customer Satisfaction (DRNPS), and technical Exam Scores—it ranks engineers on a public leaderboard and gives them a personal dashboard to trace their historical growth.

## 🛠️ Core Features
=======
The **TCS Ecosystem** is a centralized hub for tracking and visualizing engineer performance metrics. It moves beyond standard databases to provide a dynamic, real-time leaderboard ("The Podium") and a secure administrative command center. It implements a sophisticated scoring algorithm to calculate a **Technical Capability Score (TCS)** based on comprehensive KPIs, assigning engineers to dynamic tiers ranging from **Bronze** to **Masters**.

## 🛠️ What it does
- **Public Capability Audit**: Allows engineers to verify their standing and view their detailed performance profile using unique identification codes.
- **Dynamic Leaderboard**: Visualizes the top three performers on a premium "Podium" and lists all engineers in a high-impact registry.
- **Secure Management Node**: An optimized, space-efficient admin dashboard for:
    - **Manual Provisioning**: Adding and editing engineer records with real-time validation.
    - **Bulk Operations**: Bulk uploading engineer data via CSV templates with newly consolidated UI controls.
    - **Asset & Document Management**: Integrated image uploading to Firebase Storage and exporting engineer metrics to Word (.docx) and PowerPoint (.pptx).
    - **Data Archiving**: Hiding and restoring engineer records without losing historical data.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Accurately tracks application usage by separating visitor analytics from administrator session data.
- **Automated Tiering**: Real-time calculation of TCS scores (out of 100) and dynamic tier assignment based on a weighted algorithm:
    - **Operational KPIs (50%)**: REDO, IQC Skip Ratio, Maintenance Mode, OQC Pass Rate, Training Attendance, Core Parts PBA, Core Parts Octa, and Multi Parts Ratio.
    - **DRNPS (30%)**: Derived from Promoter and Detractor feedback counts.
    - **Exam Score (20%)**.
    - **Tiers**: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Masters.

### 🏆 The Hall of Fame (Leaderboard)
- **Top 10 Podium**: Displays the absolute best engineers for any given Month or Quarter.
- **Visual Prestige**: Custom tier graphics (Bronze to Masters) and engineer profile photos.
- **Dynamic Periods**: Toggle smoothly between **Monthly** and aggregated **Quarterly** rankings.

### 🔍 Engineer Self-Lookup
- Engineers log in via a unique Employee Code to view their private performance report.
- Shows historical timeline navigation to see past months/quarters.
- Granular breakdown of the score: **KPIs (Max 50)**, **DRNPS (Max 30)**, and **Exam (Max 20)**.

### 🛡️ Secure Admin Portal
- **Session Management**: Secure login with 2-hour persistent sessions via `localStorage`.
- **Bulk Provisioning**: Add records manually or bulk-import via robust **CSV Parsing**.
- **Archive System**: Soft-delete ("Archive") engineer records without losing historical data, with a 1-click restore function.
- **Asset Uploads**: Direct integration with Firebase Storage to upload engineer photos.

### 📊 Live Analytics & Audit Logs
- **Separated Traffic Analytics**: Tracks public **Visitor** sessions (duration, daily hits) completely separately from **Admin** activity.
- **Activity Log Viewer**: A dedicated, color-coded audit log tracking admin logins, record modifications, system errors, and unhandled promise rejections directly to Firestore.

### 🎖️ The 6-Tier Gamification System
TCS Scores (0-100) automatically map to physical/digital tiers:
- 🥉 **Bronze** (0–49)
- 🥈 **Silver** (50–59)
- 🥇 **Gold** (60–69)
- 💎 **Platinum** (70–79)
- 💠 **Diamond** (80–89)
- 👑 **Masters** (90–100)
