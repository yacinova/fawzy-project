# 🚀 TCS — Technical Capability System

A premium, data-driven **Engineer Performance and Ranking Platform** built with **Next.js 16** and **Firebase**. This system gamifies the technical excellence of field service engineers by dynamically measuring their monthly and quarterly KPIs, translating them into a unified **Technical Capability Score (TCS)**, and assigning them prestigious **Tiers**.

 *"Precision Defines Rank. Earn Your Tier • Own Your Title."*

## 🌟 What is this project?
The **TCS Ecosystem** replaces subjective engineer evaluations with a transparent, visually stunning, and competitive performance hub. It moves beyond standard databases to provide a dynamic, real-time leaderboard ("The Podium") and a secure administrative command center. 

By tracking core metrics—operational KPIs, Customer Satisfaction (DRNPS), and technical Exam Scores—it calculates a sophisticated **Technical Capability Score (TCS)**. This assigns engineers to dynamic tiers ranging from **Bronze** to **Masters**, while giving them a personal dashboard to trace their historical growth.

## 🛠️ Core Features
- **Public Capability Audit**: Allows engineers to verify their standing and view their detailed performance profile using unique identification codes (with robust privacy enhancements hiding codes from the public).
- **Dynamic Leaderboard**: Visualizes the top three performers on a premium "Podium" and lists all engineers in a high-impact registry, featuring seamlessly blended 3D-style tier logos optimized for dark mode.
- **Secure Management Node**: An optimized, space-efficient admin dashboard featuring:
  - **Manual Provisioning**: Adding and editing engineer records with real-time validation.
  - **Bulk Operations**: Bulk uploading engineer data via CSV templates with a newly consolidated, compact UI control grid.
  - **Asset & Document Management**: Integrated image uploading to Firebase Storage (with secure ID validation) and exporting engineer metrics to Word (.docx) and PowerPoint (.pptx).
  - **Data Archiving**: Hiding and restoring engineer records without losing historical data.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Accurately tracks application usage by strictly separating public visitor analytics from administrator session data for precise ROIs.
- **Automated Tiering**: Real-time calculation of TCS scores (out of 100) and dynamic tier assignment based on a weighted algorithm:
  - **Operational KPIs (50%)**: REDO, IQC Skip Ratio, Maintenance Mode, OQC Pass Rate, Training Attendance, Core Parts PBA, Core Parts Octa, and Multi Parts Ratio.
  - **DRNPS (30%)**: Derived from precise Promoter and Detractor feedback counts.
  - **Exam Score (20%)**.
  - **Tiers**: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond (updated assets), and Masters.

### 🏆 The Hall of Fame (Leaderboard)
- **Top 10 Podium**: Displays the absolute best engineers for any given chronological Month or correctly aggregated Quarter.
- **Visual Prestige**: Custom tier graphics (Bronze to Masters) tailored for perfect blending, alongside dynamic engineer profile photos.
- **Dynamic Periods**: Toggle smoothly between **Monthly** and aggregated **Quarterly** rankings via an intelligently sorted timeline.

### 🔍 Engineer Self-Lookup
- Engineers log in via a unique Employee Code to view their private performance report.
- Shows historical timeline navigation to see past months/quarters.
- Granular breakdown of the score: **KPIs (Max 50)**, **DRNPS (Max 30)**, and **Exam (Max 20)**.

### 🛡️ Secure Admin Portal
- **Session Management**: Secure login with 2-hour persistent sessions via `localStorage`.
- **Bulk Provisioning**: Add records manually or bulk-import via robust **CSV Parsing**.
- **Archive System**: Soft-delete ("Archive") engineer records without losing historical data, with a 1-click restore function.
- **Asset Uploads**: Direct integration with Firebase Storage to upload engineer photos natively.

### 📊 Live Analytics & Audit Logs
- **Separated Traffic Analytics**: Tracks public **Visitor** sessions (duration, daily hits) completely separately from **Admin** activity.
- **Activity Log Viewer**: A dedicated, color-coded audit log tracking admin logins, record modifications, system errors, and unhandled promise rejections directly to Firestore.

### 🎖️ The 6-Tier Gamification System
TCS Scores (0-100) automatically map to physical/digital tiers:
- 🥉 **Bronze** (0–49)
- 🥈 **Silver** (50–59)
- 🥇 **Gold** (60–69)
- 💎 **Platinum** (70–79)
- 💠 **Diamond** (80–89)
- 👑 **Masters** (90–100)
